BigData Computing and Services are receiving significant attention recently. The IEEE BigDataService 2017 conference provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to exchange innovative ideas, latest research results, as well as practical experience and lessons learnt on this topic. Its major interests include big data applications in various domains such as healthcare, business and financing, education and learning, social networks and media, smart environment, sensors and Internet of Things as well as technology aspects such as computing services and architecture, modeling, data mining and analytics, and databases. The conference will be co-located with IEEE SOSE 2017, IEEE MobileCloud 2017, and IEEE Crowd Sourcing 2017.

IEEE BigDataService 2017 will consist of main tracks and special tracks. The conference will also include the International Workshop on Intelligent Big Data Systems. The conference seeks the submission of high-quality papers limited to 10 pages (IEEE format) in length. All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings.
